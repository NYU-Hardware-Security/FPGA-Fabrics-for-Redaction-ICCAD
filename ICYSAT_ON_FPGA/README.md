# FPGA_scan_access_Attack
This is a fully automated flow to generate ORACLE and Key exposed NETLIST (in bench format) from a post synthesis FPGA RTL.
RTL Requirements: Synthesized using Synopsys DC with FreePDK 15nm
To Launch Attack: Subject the Netlist and Oracle to any typical SAT attack framework
